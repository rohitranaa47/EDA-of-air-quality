# EDA-of-air-quality

This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an air quality dataset to understand pollution trends, correlations among pollutants, and seasonal variations using Python.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes daily air pollution measurements for multiple pollutants such as:

- PM2.5
- PM10
- NO
- NO2
- NOx
- NH3
- SO2
- CO
- O3
- Benzene
- Toluene
- Xylene

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Objectives

- Handle missing values and clean the dataset.
- Explore temporal patterns (year-wise, month-wise).
- Analyze pollutant concentration trends.
- Visualize relationships between pollutants.
- Generate actionable insights for policy or research purposes.

## 📊 Key Insights

- Identified seasonal trends in PM2.5 and NO2 levels.
- Detected sharp variations in pollutant levels over years.
- Visualized heatmaps and pairplots to show correlations between pollutants.
